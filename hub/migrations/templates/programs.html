        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>IVOC meets with 6 - 8 teens weekly for 10 weeks.</p>
        <p>Throughout this opportunity we learn to embrace the power of self-expression through music, cipher, spoken word, lyric writing and more. Each participant is provided the space and therapeutic guidance to express themselves. The topics of discussion as well as the content thatâ€™s created each week are driven by our teen participants. Healthy relationships are forged, team building takes place, along with greater self-awareness and most importantly, our teens share their truth and feel heard. By the end of this opportunity, participants will have recorded their truth over an instrumental. Connect with us to find out more.</p>

        <h2>Photo & Video</h2>
        <p>Youth are provided the opportunity to collaborate with professional videographers and develop a project from beginning to end. This is an especially powerful internship opportunity for young aspiring videographers, writers and future creatives alike. Throughout this opportunity, we ensure youth share equitable space with the team and their perspective is equally valued. IVOC core themes within this opportunity are self-identity (who are you), goal setting (to achieve the dream), and professionalism. Connect with us to learn more about this inspiring opportunity.</p>
